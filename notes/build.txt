we did not specify target: execute all; APPLICATION was defined => execute all1
all1: etc tools src app img

ETC
=======
etc: config eposcfg eposcc.conf eposmkbi.conf
config: config.h (config always execute?)
    defines SMOD, ARCH, MACH, etc. in config.h
eposcfg: FORCE
    removes eposcfg executable
eposcc.conf and eposmkbi.conf: FORCE
    use eposcfg to build .conf files (which I suppose are used by tools?)
=======

SRC
=======

=======

CLEAN
=======
-clean:
    etc: resets config.h
    app: do nothing?
    src: everything below src? or excludes system, image, init?
    img: do nothing?
-cleanapps:
    clean for every app
-veryclean: clean cleanapps cleantest

Doubts:
- Does epos need eposcfg to use makedefs?
- I saw .sdata as section 1 (right after .init), werent we assuming they would
    be contiguous on the logical address space?
