Patch against c0b8a2517f80f0667ce23e30b51e39c705807a9b: Memory management (multiheap, Address_Space and Segment)

We've implemented the following API interfaces

Thread
Mutex
Semaphore
Clock
Chronometer
Display (Shouldn't be on the API, but philosopher_dinner needs it and it is a good test)
Task
Segment
Address_Space

Currently, we have the following tests available:
1) Syscalls: make APPS='loader test_syscalls' run
2) producer_consumer: make APPS='loader producer_consumer producer_consumer' run
3) philosophers_dinner + hello: make APPS='loader hello philosophers_dinner' run
4) test_switch_context: make APPS='loader test_switch_context test_switch_context' run
