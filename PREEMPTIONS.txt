Before the Task ctor on Thread::init(), no S-mode int takes place
For a short period during the creation of the Loader's Task, we receive a few i=17 ints
Until Context::load(), no more S-mode int takes place // sie.S_TIMER will be on, but sstatus.SIE will be off; right?

Then, we load the first thread in U-mode, and the following may happen until it reaches its quantum

- nonblocking syscall
- time tick
- blocking syscall
- end-of-quantum

Switch context has to deal with two cases: new thread vs old thread
A new thread is one that has never executed switch_context.
